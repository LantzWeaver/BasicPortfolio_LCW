I graduated from Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC with a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration with an International Business Concentration in the Spring of 2016. As an Undergraduate, I was very involved on campus as a Resident Assistant, the Winthrop University Quidditch Team President, and various other leadership roles including many within the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity.</p>

Assistant at Wells Fargo Advisors-Camden Financial Partners, LLC, a Resident Assistant and Desk Host for Winthrop University Residence Life, and a Customer Service Representative for LPL Financial. I have also taken part in multiple volunteer oportunities including serving as a Youth Leader at my church, serving as Treasurer for the Pi Kappa Phi-Epsilon Eta Housing Corporation, Inc., and  managing the Pi Kappa Phi fraternity house.</p>
