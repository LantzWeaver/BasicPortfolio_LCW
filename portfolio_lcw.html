	<h2>Connect with Me</h2> 

	<p>&nbsp; My name is Lantz Weaver, and I am an up and coming web developer. I am originally from Camden, South Carolina. I graduated from Winthrop University in Rock Hill, SC with a Bachelors of Science in Business Administration with an International Business Concentration in the Spring of 2016.</p>

	<br>

	<p>&nbsp; As an Undergraduate, I was very involved on campus as a Resident Assistant, the Winthrop University Quidditch Team President, and various other leadership roles including many within the Pi Kappa Phi Fraternity.</p>

	<br>

	<p>&nbsp; Currently, I am team member of Penn Station: East Coast Subs in Rock Hill, SC. My previous work experience includes time as an I.T. Assistant at Wells Fargo Advisors-Camden Financial Partners, LLC, a Resident Assistant and Desk Host for Winthrop University Residence Life, and a Customer Service Representative for LPL Financial.</p>

	<br>

	<p>&nbsp; I have taken part in multiple volunteer oportunities including serving as a Youth Leader at my church, serving as Treasurer for the Pi Kappa Phi-Epsilon Eta Housing Corporation, Inc., and as the Pi Kappa Phi House Manager.

	<br>

	<p>&nbsp; In my free time, I enjoy travelling, hiking, golfing, reading, and watching SitComs such as "Freinds," "The Office," and "Parks and Recreation." I have been to 5 different continents and 19 different Countries.</p>
